      <section>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>I noticed that the poster depicting all the tour dates lacked the <code>alt</code> attribute which
          describes it for
          those
          who
          rely on screen readers. It wasn't particularly necessary because they could find the same information by
          visiting the link to Ticketmaster at the bottom of the page. However, I liked the typography used in the
          poster
          and wanted to make it more interactive by showing information when a user interacts with each date.</p>

        <p class="definition"><dfn>Screen readers</dfn> tells those who are visually impaired, illiterate, or have a learning
          disability what
          is
          on
          the screen through speech or braille.</p>

          <li><span class="bold">Design: </span>I designed the user experience and interface with sketching and
            Photoshop.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Development: </span>I wrote the user interface code with React, JavaScript, and
            CSS.</li>

        <h2>Challenge: Redesign</h2>
        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>To make the poster interactive, I decided that more information shows up when a fan clicks or taps each
          date. They wouldn't need to leave the site unless they wanted to buy tickets, which I provide a direct
          link to. Originally, fans can go to Ticketmaster at the bottom of the page and then they find the
          show they want to go to. However, some fans may see the city closest to them on the poster already, so
          my
          redesign gives them a quick way to buy those tickets.</p>

        <figure>
          <img class="this-is-america-tour-small" src="../dist/images/this-is-america-tour-sketch.png"
               alt="Planning redesign and React structure">
          <figcaption>Planning redesign and React structure</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Slice Shows with Photoshop</h3>
        <p>To make it simpler to implement, I designed the shows to be laid out in a grid. This required each show
          from the poster to be separated into multiple image files, which I did with Photoshop's slice tool.</p>

        <figure>
          <img class="this-is-america-tour-small" src="../dist/images/this-is-america-tour-slice.png"
               alt="Shows sliced with Photoshop">
          <figcaption>Shows sliced with Photoshop</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Display Shows in Original Order</h3>
        <p>With the images ready, I was able to write the React code to display the shows in a grid. I planned to use the data from Ticketmaster to correctly order the shows, but Childish Gambino suffered a leg injury midway through the tour, so the remaining shows were rescheduled in a different order. At the time of development, there was no updated poster, so I thought it made sense to display the shows in the original order and indicate that it has been rescheduled. I was able to sort the data from Ticketmaster by the original order of shows by modifying JavaScript's sort function.</p>

        <h3>Make Site Accessible
        </h3>
        <p>After writing most of the React code, each show can be clicked or tapped on to reveal more information
          about the show, but it wasn't quite at the level of accessibility I wanted yet. Some elements of the site couldn't be interacted with
          the keyboard by default, so I had to add the <code>tabindex</code> attribute to indicate that it is able
          to be
          interacted with the keyboard. I also added the <code>alt</code> and <code>title</code> attributes to
          images and interactable
          elements such as links. They provide screen readers with a description to read out since some links
          aren't easily understandable.</p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>My redesign of Childish Gambino's This Is America Tour website makes it more accessible and makes the
          poster
          interactive by enabling users to navigate with the keyboard and adding descriptions to images and
          interactable
          elements for screen readers. Clicking or tapping on the shows in the poster displays more information
          about
          it
          without having to go to Ticketmaster.</p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>

        <h3>Measuring Success</h3>
        <p>My redesign was somewhat successful because it is more accessible than the original website and the
          poster is
          interactive now, but it might have been unnecessary to do. Fans could directly visit Ticketmaster at the
          bottom
          of the original site to get tickets, which is accessible to those who rely on screen readers. However, I
          wanted
          to try something different and learn more about React and making websites accessible, which I
          accomplished.
        </p>

        <h3>If I Could Redo This Redesign</h3>
        <p>If I could redo this redesign, I would learn more about what could be done to make websites more accessible
          because I don't think I did enough.</p>

        <h3>What I Learned:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="bold">React: </span>I had no experience with React prior to this redesign, so I was
            able to learn and practice
            its
            basics.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">HTTP requests: </span>My previous experience with HTTP requests were only with
            PHP, which turns out to be
            similar
            in JavaScript, just written differently. HTTP requests are used to get data from other websites,
            like
            Ticketmaster.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Making sites more accessible: </span>I only knew about the <code>alt</code>
            attribute for
            images and using semantic HTML
            before
            this project. Now, I know how to add descriptions to links and make certain elements able to be
            navigated
            with the keyboard.</li>
