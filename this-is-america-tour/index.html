        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>I wanted to redesign the website to try to make the poster interactive and more accessible because it
	  originally lacked a description, which is useful for accessibility. I also wanted to try developing a site
	  with React, a JavaScript library for making user interfaces.</p>

            Photoshop.</li>

        <h2>Challenge: Redesign</h2>
        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>I decided to make the poster interactive by displaying a show's details, such as city, venue, and link
	  to buy tickets, when a fan interacts with a date. This accommodated fans who see the poster first to see 
	  if the artist will visit a city near them. They wouldn't need to find the same show again when they visit
	  Ticketmaster.</p>

                      alt="Sketch of plan of how to display show information when user interacts with date from poster">
          <figcaption>Planning redesign and React structure</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>Slice Shows with Photoshop</h3>
        <p>My idea was to lay out the dates in a grid to make it simpler to implement, which means that each date
	  had to be a separate image file. This was made possible using Photoshop's slice tool.</p>
        <figure> <img class="this-is-america-tour-small" src="../dist/images/this-is-america-tour-slice.png"
                      alt="Poster of tour dates where each date is separated">
          <figcaption>Shows sliced with Photoshop</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>Display Shows in Original Order</h3>
        <p>Originally, I was going to use Ticketmaster data to correctly order the dates, but shows were rescheduled
	  in a different order when Childish Gambino suffered a leg injury. There was no updated poster while I
	  was developing the site, so I decided to display the shows in the original order but indicating that
	  they have been rescheduled.</p>
        <h3>Make Site Accessible </h3>
        <p>After implementing most of the site, it wasn't quite at the level of accessibility that I wanted yet.
	  I had to add descriptions to the links and images for screen readers users, and make the site accessible 
	  with just the keyboard.</p>
	<p class="definition"><dfn>Screen readers</dfn> tells those who are visually impaired, illiterate, or have a
          learning disability what is on the screen through speech or braille.</p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <h3>Measuring Success</h3>
        <p>This project was successful because I implemented my redesign of the website which made the poster
	  interactive and more accessible with React. I believe I could have done much more to practice making
	  a website more accessible though.</p>
        <h3>What I Learned:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="bold">React: </span>I had no experience with React prior to this redesign, so I was
            able to learn and practice its basics.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">HTTP requests: </span>My previous experience with HTTP requests were only with
            PHP, which turns out to be similar in JavaScript, just written differently. HTTP requests are used
            to get data from other websites, like Ticketmaster.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Making sites more accessible: </span>I only knew about the <code>alt</code>
            attribute for images and using semantic HTML before this project. Now, I know how to add
            descriptions to links and make certain elements able to be navigated with the keyboard.</li>
