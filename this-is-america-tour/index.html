                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>This is a redesign for Childish Gambino’s This is America Tour website. The goal of the redesign was
                    make the site more accessible to people with disabilities because I noticed that the page lacked
                    alt tags to describe the images. One of the images depicted all the shows for this tour, but there
                    was nothing to allow users who may have trouble seeing to understand what was there. The only way
                    to get information about those shows was to visit the link at the bottom of the page. </p>

                <figure>
                    <pre>
                          <code>
&lt;img id="dates" src="http://pharos.earth/zh2vS78NDr/dates.png" style="margin: 0 auto"&gt;
              </code>
              </pre>
                    <figcaption>Snippet of code from original site where no alt tag used to describe the image with all
                        of the tour dates</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Preparation</h2>
                <p>In preparation for the redesign, I sliced out all the dates from the poster depicting the tour dates
                    using Photoshop. This was done to maintain the original aesthetic, but also allow me more easily
                    add accessibility tags to tell visually impaired users what the date and city the show would take
                    place in, since it is an image.</p>
                    <figure>
                            <div class="figure-img">
                                <img src="../src/images/this-is-america-tour-slice.png" alt="Sliced out all show dates">
                            </div>

                        </figure>
                    

                <p>I sketched out a design that would show information about each tour date that I thought could help
                    the user understand more about the show. Initially, I chose to display the date, city, venue, and a
                    link to get tickets.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Challenges</h2>

                <h3>Keeping All Show Information Together</h3>

                <p>A major concept of React is splitting the user interface into separate usable components. One
                    component can have multiple components within
                    it. Each component can store data in
                    a React concept called “props”, which can pass data down from component to component. I utilized
                    this when I separated each show into several components so that they have access to the same data.
                    For example, one component displays the link to get tickets while one component displays the date,
                    city, venue, and special guest. </p>

                <p>
                    It was relatively easy to acquire the information I needed from the JSON file that was received
                    from my
                    API calls to Ticketmaster, but I had a challenging time keeping the information together per show.
                    This
                    is because the storing of information and the displaying of the information is done at separate
                    times.
                    I needed to keep information about each show separately because I would be displaying it all
                    separately.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I was able to do so by storing the information about each show in an object, which the show is then
                    stored in an array. This results in an array of show objects. I stored this array of objects in a
                    React
                    concept called “state”, which allows components to be dynamic and updated at any time. This allows
                    me
                    to use the information I just stored as props to pass down to other components.
                </p>

                <h3>Order of Shows</h3>

                <p>Another challenge I ran into was with the order of the shows. Childish Gambino suffered a leg injury
                    midway through the tour, so the remaining dates were either rescheduled or cancelled. The shows in
                    the JSON file were neither ordered by the original schedule nor the new schedule. This was a
                    problem because I wanted to order the shows by the original schedule.</p>

                <p>Fortunately, all the rescheduled dates were in December, so I could use the dates to display the
                    shows in the original order. I used the JavaScript sort function with the optional <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort#Parameters"
                        target="_blank">compareFunction</a> to sort it by an array that had the rescheduled dates in
                    the original order.</p>

            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>Overall, this website redesign was successful in that I was able to complete a project utilizing the
                    React library and AJAX to get data from the Ticketmaster API. I was also able to make it more
                    accessible than the original website by adding title and alt tags to every link and image, but also
                    allowing users to interact with the site with a keyboard. Title and alt tags are probably not
                    enough, so I plan to add more to make the site accessible to a wider audience. </p>
                <p>I was able to
                    receive some feedback on the redesign and I will use it to improve the site. For example, the shows
                    are way too big when viewing on a mobile device, so it may require many swipes to access the
                    desired show. I may make it so that the image of the date is replaced with text, which will reduce
                    the height of each show thus reducing the amount of swipes needed.</p>
