			<h1>Inferhythm</h1>
			<p class="subtitle">Browser extension</p>
			<p class="summary">Inferhythm is a browser extension that helps users find lyrics from the website
				<a href="https://genius.com/">Genius</a> for the track they are currently listening to on Spotify.</p>
			<p class="definition">Lyrics from Genius typically also have annotations and interpretations submitted by
				contributors, editors, musicians, and fans.</p>

			<h2>Motivation</h2>
			<p>I wanted a convenient way to get lyrics for the track I am listening to like the experience found using
				Genius' Android app, but on desktop operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).</p>

			<h2>Contributions</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="bold">Research: </span>I tried similar browser extensions to avoid remaking any.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Design: </span> I designed the user experience, user interface, and icon.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Development: </span>I wrote HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to present data from
					Spotify
					and Genius.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Testing: </span> I wrote tests with Jest, a JavaScript testing framework.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Challenge: Get Lyrics in One Click</h2>
			<p>I wrote HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to implement my design where the lyrics results pop up when the
				user clicks Inferhythm's button in the toolbar.</p>
			<figure> <img src="../dist/images/inferhythm-toolbar.png"
					alt="Inferhythm's button containing its logo in Google Chrome's toolbar" id="inferhythm-toolbar">

			</figure>
			<h3>Manually Create Genius Page Links</h3>
			<p>To open the lyrics in a new tab, a valid link is required. I noticed that the structure of links to
				Genius
				pages were like <em> genius.com/artist-name-track-title-lyrics</em>, so I thought I could
				programmatically manipulate
				track data to match that structure.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, it was not very reliable because some artists had symbols in their names like a dollar
				sign which created invalid links because it was not consistently handled by Genius.</p>
			<figure>
				<figcaption>Comparison of links created manually versus actual links used by Genius</figcaption>
				<table>
					<thead>
						<tr>
							<th scope="col">Artist Name</th>
							<th scope="col">Manually Create Link</th>
							<th scope="col">Actual Genius Link</th>
						</tr>
					</thead>
					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td>A$AP Rocky</td>
							<td>asap-rocky</td>
							<td>a-ap-rocky</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Ty Dolla $ign</td>
							<td>ty-dolla-sign</td>
							<td>ty-dolla-sign</td>
						</tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>
			</figure>
			<p>This also happened for tracks that indicated features, remixes, or remasters in their title.</p>
			<h3>Get Links Directly from Genius</h3>
			<p>I looked for a solution by exploring the code of over 15 related GitHub repositories to see how they got
				a valid link. Some manually created links like I did, while others used Genius' search function.</p>
			<p>I tried the search function and immediately saw better results since all the links worked.</p>
			<h3>Optimize Search Queries</h3>
			<p>However, one generalized search query did not always produce accurate results. I added another similar
				but more detailed search query, which improved the results.</p>
			<p>Consequently, I merged the results of the two search queries.</p>

			<h2>Reflection</h2>
			<h3>Measuring Success</h3>
			<p>Inferhythm was successful because it does what I designed it to do. I had to diverge from the design
				though by displaying a list of results first instead of directly going to the lyrics page because I was
				unable to consistently get the correct lyrics.</p>
			<h3>What I Learned:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="bold">Writing tests: </span>It would have been easier to write tests as I worked
					instead of all of them at once near the end of development. There is the added confidence knowing
					that the code works error-free.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Cookies: </span> I used cookies to keep the user's session, so they didn't have
					to re-login every time their browser reopens.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Asynchronous programming: </span>I made use of asynchronous programming when
					getting data from Spotify and Genius. It was helpful in performing actions in a specific order since
					some actions depend on others. Specifically, I made use of promises and their async/await syntax.
				</li>
