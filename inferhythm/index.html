            Inferhythm is a Google Chrome extension that helps users find lyrics
            from the website Genius for the track they are currently listening
            to on Spotify. These lyrics typically also have annotations and
            interpretations submitted by contributors, editors, musicians, and
            fans. It was created on my own and it is published in the Chrome Web
            Store.

          <h2>Motivation</h2>
          <p>
            Sometimes I read lyrics on Genius to help me understand what the
            artist was singing or rapping. I can conveniently get the lyrics
            while listening to music on my Android smartphone if the Genius app
            was installed. A notification appears that I can tap to open the
            lyrics in the app. However, this functionality isn't available on
            desktop operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) where I also spend
            time listening to music. I wanted that same convenience while using
            a desktop operating system, which is why I created Inferhythm.

          <h2>Contributions</h2>
          <p>
            I was responsible for the research, design, development, and testing
            in the solo creation of Inferhythm. I had to research so that I
            could avoid remaking what has already been done, which involved me
            downloading similar browser extensions and see how they functioned.
            I designed the user experience, interface, and icon where my goal
            was to adapt the style of the Genius website as best I could. This
            was so that it's clear that there is a connection between Inferhythm
            and Genius. I developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which
            receives data from the Spotify and Genius through their APIs. An API
            enables the communication between applications. Testing was done
            with Jest, a JavaScript testing framework, where I wrote unit and
            integration tests.

          <h2>Challenge: Get Lyrics in One Click</h2>
          <p>
            Inferhythm's purpose is to get the lyrics from Genius for the track
            the user is currently listening to. I had to program it to open the
            lyrics in a new tab upon the user clicking Inferhythm's button.
          </p>

                src="../dist/images/inferhythm-toolbar-icon.png"
                alt="Inferhythm's button"
              />

          </figure>

          <h3>Manually Creating Links</h3>
          <p>
            I noticed in my experience with Genius was that the link was
            something like genius.com/artist-name-track-title-lyrics, so I
            thought I do the same, but found that it wasn't very reliable. The
            tracks on Spotify that indicated features, remixes, or remasters in
            their title typically resulted in invalid links. Similarly, some
            artists had symbols like a dollar sign in their names resulted in
            invalid links because they weren't consistently handled on Genius.
            For example, the links for A$AP Rocky tracks become a-ap-rocky,
            while for Ty Dolla $ign's tracks become ty-dolla-sign. I considered
            adding a feature where users can report tracks that caused problems
            and I could update the code accordingly, but I opted to find a
            different solution first.
          </p>
          <h3>Researching Projects Related to Genius</h3>
          <p>
            I went on GitHub and analyzed the code for applications that had
            some connection to Genius to help me find a solution to getting a
            valid link. After analyzing over fifteen repositories, I found that
            some applications manually created links like I tried before, but
            other ones made use of the Genius API. As a result, I tried using
            the Genius API's query function on their website and found that it
            was much more reliable in getting a valid link. The query didn't
            have to be as precise as the manually created links, so I added it
            in to Inferhythm.
          </p>

          <h3>Merging Results from Two Queries</h3>
          <p>
            My solution for opening the lyrics in a new tab when the user clicks
            Inferhythm's button was to use the first result from the query using
            the Genius API. Unfortunately, like with any search engine, the
            first result may not always be what you're looking for. I decided to
            show a subset of the results in a popup, but that didn't work
            because a single query sometimes doesn't produce any results that I
            was looking for either.
          </p>
          <!-- <Figure></Figure> -->
          <p>
            As a result, I used two queries, merged their results, and showed
            them in the popup. I also added two links that searched for the
            track's lyrics on Genius and just plain lyrics on Google in case
            none of the results met the user's needs. Finally, the user can
            click on Inferhythm's button which will show a list of results that
            they can click to open lyrics on Genius in a new tab.

          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>
            Inferhythm was successful because reading lyrics on Genius on a
            desktop operating system more convenient, which matches the
            convenience of their Android app.

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            Successfully completing Inferhythm is quite meaningful because it is
            the first project I developed that is personally useful to use more
            than once. I was able to learn new concepts and practice ones I've
            learned in school along the way, such as cookies, asynchronous
            programming, and testing.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had to learn about cookies so that I could keep the user's
            information after closing Google Chrome so that they wouldn't need
            to authorize Inferhythm every time they wanted to use it. This led
            me to learn about the security flags I can add to make sure that the
            data within the cookies are safe from malicious activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            I learned about asynchronous programming while I had to make
            requests to the Spotify and Genius APIs. This involved using
            callback functions and promises because they will be automatically
            called when a request completes. This is helpful when making
            multiple requests that depend on each other, which means that they
            must be done in a specific order. I tried using async/await with
            promises too just to learn how to use them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Testing is important in the process, but I hadn't done it much with
            my academic projects, so this was a great opportunity to practice
            it. I don't want bugs to hinder the user experience, so I learned
            Jest to write my unit and integration testing.
