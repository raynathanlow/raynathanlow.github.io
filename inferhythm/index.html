        <p class="subtitle">Browser extension</p>
        <p class="summary">Inferhythm is a browser extension that helps users find lyrics from the website
	  <a href="https://genius.com/">Genius</a> for the track they are currently listening to on Spotify.</p>
        <p class="definition">Lyrics from Genius typically also have annotations and interpretations submitted by
          contributors, editors, musicians, and fans.</p>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>I wanted a convenient way to get lyrics for the track I'm listening to on Spotify like Genius' Android app,
	  but on desktop operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).</p>

        <h2>Contributions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="bold">Research: </span>I tried similar browser extensions to avoid remaking any.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Design: </span> I designed the user experience, user interface, and icon.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Development: </span>I wrote HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to present data from Spotify
	    and Genius.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Testing: </span> I wrote tests with Jest, a JavaScript testing framework.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Challenge: Get Lyrics in One Click</h2>
        <p>I had to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to implement my design where the lyrics open in a new tab when
	  the user clicks Inferhythm's button in the toolbar.</p>
	<figure> <img src="../dist/images/inferhythm-toolbar.png"
		      alt="Inferhythm's button containing its logo in Google Chrome's toolbar"
                      id="inferhythm-toolbar">
          <figcaption>Inferhythm's button in toolbar</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>Manually Create Genius Page Links</h3>
        <p>To open the lyrics in a new tab, I just need a valid link. I noticed that the structure of links to Genius
	  pages were like <em> genius.com/artist-name-track-title-lyrics</em>, so I thought I could programmatically manipulate
	  track data to match that structure.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, it wasn't very reliable because some artists had symbols in their names like a dollar sign
	  which created invalid links because it wasn't consistently handled by Genius.</p>
        <figure>
          <table>
	    <figcaption>Comparison of links created manually versus actual links used by Genius</figcaption>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th scope="col">Artist Name</th>
                <th scope="col">Manually Create Link</th>
                <th scope="col">Actual Genius Link</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>A$AP Rocky</td>
                <td>asap-rocky</td>
                <td>a-ap-rocky</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Ty Dolla $ign</td>
                <td>ty-dolla-sign</td>
                <td>ty-dolla-sign</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </figure>
        <p>This also happened for tracks that indicate features, remixes, or remasters in their title.</p>
        <h3>Get Links Directly from Genius</h3>
        <p>I needed to find a solution, so I went through several related GitHub repositories to see how they got links.
	  Some manually created links like I did, while others used Genius' search function.</p>
	<p>I tried the search function and immediately saw better results since all the links worked.</p>
        <h3>Optimize Search Queries</h3>
        <p>However, one generalized query sometimes didn't show accurate results, so I added another similar, but more detailed
	  query which often helps.</p>
        <p>As a result, I merged the results of the two queries which is displayed in the popup when the user clicks
	  Inferhythm's button in the toolbar.</p>

		      alt="Inferhythm's results for Electric Light Orchestra's Mr.Blue Sky alternately labelled Query 1 and Query 2"
                      id="inferhythm-results-merged">
          <figcaption>Results from query 1 and 2 merged</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <h3>Measuring Success</h3>
        <p>Inferhythm was successful because it does what I designed it to do, just with one slight difference. A list
	  of results from Genius' search function is displayed instead of directly going to a Genius page because I couldn't
	  consistently get the lyrics that accurately matched the currently playing track.</p>
        <h3>What I Learned:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="bold">Writing tests: </span>It would have been easier on me to write tests as I worked
            instead of writing them all at once near the end when the code is more complicated. They'll also 
            give me some confidence knowing that the code works without errors as I work towards fully
            implementing my design.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Cookies: </span> I used them to keep the user's session so that they wouldn't
            need to log in with Spotify again after reopening Google Chrome. This involved learning the security
            flags cookies use to prevent malicious activity.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Asynchronous programming: </span>I made use of it to get data from Spotify and Genius.
	    It was helpful in performing actions in a specific order since some actions depend on others. Specifically,
	    I made use of promises and their async/await syntax.</li>
        </ul>
