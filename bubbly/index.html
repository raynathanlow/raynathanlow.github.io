        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>With my team, we spent 10 weeks using multiple research methods with our design focus of creating an interconnected method of communication between the different teams and departments of Procurify in mind. All the research we conducted enabled
          us to find the design opportunities to eventually come up with Bubbly and refine it over the following four weeks.</p>

        <p>The first 10 weeks informed us that they have many inefficient meetings and their office layout limits communication between those two teams. Consequently, Bubbly was designed to help facilitate communication between customer-facing and development
          teams.
        </p>

        <p>We designed Bubbly so there are two versions. A desktop version allows employees to only view and manage their own team’s project bubble. A Team Board, on the other hand, would show the announcements and all project bubbles. Individuals can also
          log in to comment on announcements. The separation of the two versions ideally encourage employees to have to approach the Team Board to view announcements and project bubbles and talk to others they normally would not speak to.</p>

        <h2>Contributions</h2>
        <p>My contributions include writing content for posters and planning the activities for Procurify employees to complete. For the first four weeks, we observed how the company worked and conducted informal interviews. I helped write and proofread
          the content for the posters that presented our findings in those weeks. After that, there were two major sets of activities that I helped plan for employees to complete, which helped us discover any design opportunities.</p>

        <p>One of the design opportunities allowed for Bubbly, which I helped ideate the concept of Bubbly to make it more suitable for Procurify’s situation. Once we had a concept, I also helped build the prototype using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript within
          a flat-file content management system (CMS) known as <a href="https://getgrav.org/">Grav</a>. A flat-file CMS manages text files used to display webpages and the data used is also stored onto text files instead of a database.</p>

        <h2>Challenge</h2>

        <p>A major challenge I encountered was with the building of the prototype. I was not able to program the functionality so bubbles can be created using the Grav CMS. We used a plugin called “Add Page By Form”, which would create pages that could later
          be iterated through to be displayed as bubbles on the homepage. Unfortunately, I was unfamiliar with how the <a href="https://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/yaml">YAML</a> frontmatter in those pages communicated with the rest of the CMS. The YAML
          frontmatter, which is also known as headers, is the block of code that is processed by Grav to configure the page. This code must be correctly configured the page for the iterator to find the appropriate pages to display on the homepage.</p>

          <figcaption>YAML frontmatter for adding project bubble</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>I was able to get through this problem by analyzing how the examples in the Grav documentation and playing around with the variables to understand how they worked. In the end, I was able to configure the form’s frontmatter so that it was created
          in the appropriate folder and it had the appropriate attributes for the iterator to find either the announcements or the projects.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>Bubbly was successful in that the research we gathered in those four months supported the final design. It addressed the problems we discovered regarding their frequent inefficient meetings and where different departments did not know what each
          other was working on. </p>

        <p>If I had a chance to do this again, I would like to code the prototype using PHP and MySQL. This is so the data would be stored in an actual database instead of the YAML frontmatter, which is typically used to store metadata. It also allows for
          comments to be easily created, organized, and stored unlike Grav. </p>

        <p>I learned more about how a flat-file CMS like Grav worked, especially the YAML frontmatter that is used to configure pages. I also learned about different methods of research and what a designer should consider and empathize when designing for
          someone else.
