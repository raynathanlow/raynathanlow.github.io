            <p class="subtitle">Spotify companion app</p>
            <p class="summary">Sort Plus is a progressive web app (PWA) created on my own that provides alternative
                sorting options to Spotify. Currently, it can sort by duration or release year.</p>
            <p class="definition"><dfn>Progressive web apps</dfn> enhance regular web apps so that they can make use of
                both web and native app features. This means that it can be accessed via a link on web browsers like a
                typical website, but also can be installed like an app so that it can launched from the device's home
                screen.</p>

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>I wanted to find an album saved in my Spotify library that I could listen to in its entirety within the
                limited amount of time I had. My solution had to be accessible on both mobile and desktop, and it had to
                work offline because I don't have data on my phone.</p>

            <h2>Contributions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">Research: </span>I looked into what data was available through the Spotify API to
                    sort my saved albums by. I also went through the Sonos and Spotify forums to see what similar
                    features users requested.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Design: </span>I designed the user experience, user interface, and icon. </li>
                <li><span class="bold">Development: </span>I designed the database and API with MongoDB and Express,
                    respectively. I wrote the front-end (user interface) code with React.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Deployment: </span>I deployed Sort Plus to Heroku.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="definition"><dfn>API</dfn> stands for Application Programming Interface which enables the
                communication between applications like Sort Plus and Spotify.</p>

            <h2>Challenge: Make it Work Offline</h2>
            <p>Sort Plus is designed to work offline which means that it should cache the data necessary for offline
                usage. When data is cached, it remains on the device for future use. I had to program it so that it
                caches the necessary data, which includes all the user's saved albums from their Spotify library among
                other data. </p>
            <h3>Attempt to Configure Cache</h3>
            <p>Progressive web apps have a special script (code) called a service worker which is used to configure what
                data is cached, for how long, and when to update it, among other things. I used Create React App to
                quickly get started with React, but it generates an unconfigurable service worker. Fortunately, I was
                able to follow a tutorial that helped me generate a new service worker and tell Sort Plus to use that
                instead. This allowed me to choose what data to cache, but it didn't work well with the API I designed.
                This API communicates with Spotify and with the front-end.</p>
            <h3>Modify API to Cache More Efficiently</h3>
            <p>The problem with the API I designed was that one request responds with all saved albums in the user's
                library. The service worker caches per request so any updates to the library forces a recache of
                everything, wasting the user's bandwidth. As a result, I had to modify the API so that one request
                responds with only one saved album's worth of data. Sort Plus can still get the user's library, but one
                saved album at a time. I could then configure the service worker so that it only caches saved albums not
                already cached.</p>

            </figure>
            <h3>Write Front End</h3>
            <p>The missing piece to make Sort Plus work offline is the user interface which I wrote using React. I wrote
                a component for the button that updates its appearance depending on what is happening the background to
                determine whether the user can cache all the data for offline use. </p>
            <p>When Sort Plus is connected to the Internet, it synchronizes the database with the user's current data on
                Spotify, and then compares that the cache on their device. If there are any discrepancies, then the user
                can click the button to update their cache to match their current data. After caching, the user can use
                Sort Plus offline.</p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>I deployed Sort Plus to <a href="https://sort-plus.herokuapp.com/">Heroku</a> where anyone with a Spotify
                account can use for free. It is a progressive web app so it can it is accessible with a typical web
                address. Its offline capabilities only work on some web browsers, versions, and operating systems due to
                the technology being relatively new.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <h3>Measuring Success</h3>
            <p>Sort Plus was successful because it functions the way I designed it to. Unfortunately, I don't find
                myself wanting to use it as much as I thought, but it may be due to a change in my listening habits.
            </p>
            <h3>If I Could Redo Sort Plus</h3>
            <p>If I could redo Sort Plus, I would reduce the scope of the minimum viable product so that I could test
                its usefulness before committing a lot of time into a project that may not be successful. Fortunately,
                Sort Plus was successful, and I was able to learn a lot.</p>
            <h3>What I Learned:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js): </span>Prior to this project, I
                    only had experience with React and some backend (server and database) experience with PHP and MySQL.
                    I learned how to write the backend with Express, which connects to MongoDB with Mongoose.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">PWA (Progressive Web App): </span>I learned more about progressive web apps so
                    that I could make Sort Plus work offline. They can be accessible across different platforms and can
                    be made to work offline for users who don't always have access to the Internet.</li>
