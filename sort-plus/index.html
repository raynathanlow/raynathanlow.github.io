			<h1>Sort Plus</h1>
			<p class="subtitle">Spotify companion web app</p>
			<p class="summary">Sort Plus finds albums users can fully listen to in the limited amount of time they have.
			</p>
			<p>It has the following features that makes it a

			<ul>
				<li>Work offline</li>
				<li>Accessible via a link like a typical website</li>
				<li>Installable like an app so that it can be launched from the device's home screen</li>

			<h2>Languages and Tools</h2>
			<p>MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), JavaScript, CSS, Mongoose, Git, Heroku, Figma</p>

			<h2>Motivation</h2>
			<p>I wanted to find an album saved in my Spotify library that I could listen to in its entirety within the
				limited amount of time I had.</p>

			<h2>Contributions</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="bold">Research: </span>I looked into what data was available from Spotify to
					sort my saved albums by. I also went through the Sonos and Spotify forums to see what similar
					features users requested.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Design: </span>I designed the user experience, user interface, and icon. </li>
				<li><span class="bold">Development: </span>I wrote the back-end (database and server) code with MongoDB
					and Express. I wrote the front-end (user interface) code with React.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Deployment: </span>I deployed Sort Plus to Heroku, a cloud platform that lets
					users put apps onto the Internet.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Challenge: Make it Work Offline</h2>
			<p>Sort Plus is designed to work offline which means that I had to program it to download the necessary data
				for it to work offline.</p>

			<h3>Control Which Data to Download</h3>
			<p>I can control which data is downloaded and saved on the device through code called <em>service
					worker</em>, but I could not manage to configure it with the template that I started out with.</p>
			<p>Fortunately, I found a tutorial that taught me how to generate a new service worker that was
				configurable.</p>

			<h3>Change How Data is Requested and Sent</h3>
			<p>I wanted the service worker to only download data that was not already on the device, but the code I
				initially wrote could not work that way.</p>
			<p>Initially, one request sends all the user's saved albums, which forces the user to redownload everything
				whenever their library updates.</p>

					id="sort-plus-before">
				<figcaption>Initially, one request sends all the user's saved albums</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>Now, one request sends only one saved album, so the service worker knows which data to download or not.
			</p>

					alt="Three separate requests where each one sends one saved album" id="sort-plus-after">
				<figcaption>After some modifications, one request sends only one saved album</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<h3>Implement Visual Feedback</h3>
			<p>Finally, I programmed the component that provides visual feedback that shows when Sort Plus is syncing
				and when the user can download the necessary data for offline use.</p>

			<h2>Reflection</h2>
			<h3>Measuring Success</h3>
			<p>Sort Plus was successful because it functions the way I designed it to. Unfortunately, I do not find
				myself using it much as I thought I would. It may be a problem with the design or a change in my
				listening habits.
			</p>

			<h3>What I Learned:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="bold">Minimum viable product (MVP): </span>Developing a minimum viable product would
					have been helpful to test its usefulness before committing a lot of time.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js): </span>Prior to this project, I
					only had experience with React and some backend (server and database) experience with PHP and MySQL.
					I learned how to write the backend with Express, which connects to MongoDB with Mongoose.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">PWA (Progressive Web App): </span>I learned more about progressive web apps so
					that I could make Sort Plus work offline, accessible via a link, and installable like an app that
					can be launched from the device's home screen.</li>
