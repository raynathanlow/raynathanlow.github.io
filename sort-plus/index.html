        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>I wanted to find an album saved in my Spotify library that I could listen to in its entirety within the
          limited amount of time I had.</p>

        <h2>Contributions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="bold">Research: </span>I looked into what data was available from Spotify to
            sort my saved albums by. I also went through the Sonos and Spotify forums to see what similar
            features users requested.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Design: </span>I designed the user experience, user interface, and icon. </li>
          <li><span class="bold">Development: </span>I wrote the back-end (database and server) code with MongoDB
	    and Express. I wrote the front-end (user interface) code with React.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">Deployment: </span>I deployed Sort Plus to Heroku, a cloud platform that lets
	    users put apps onto the Internet.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>Challenge: Make it Work Offline</h2>
        <p>Sort Plus is designed to work offline which means that it must download the necessary data for it to work
	  offline, which I had to program.</p>
        <h3>Control Which Data to Download</h3>
        <p>I can control which data is downloaded and saved on the device through code called <em>service
	    worker</em>, but it was not configurable with the template I started out with.</p>
	<p>Fortunately, I found a tutorial that taught me how me how to generate a new service worker to configure and
	  use.</p>
        <h3>Change How Data is Requested and Sent</h3>
        <p>I wanted the service worker to only download data that is not already on the device, but there was a problem
	  with how I initially wrote the code to manage how data is requested and sent.</p>
	<p>Initially, one request sends all the user's saved albums, which forces them to redownload everything
	  whenever their library has updated.</p>

          <figcaption>One request sends all the user's saved albums</figcaption>
        </figure>

	<p>Now, one request sends only one saved album, so the service worker knows which data to download
	  or not.</p>

          <figcaption>One request sends only one saved album</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>Implement Visual Feedback</h3>
        <p>Finally, I programmed the component that provides visual feedback as Sort Plus prepares for offline
	  use and can start the download process, depending on its current state.</p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <h3>Measuring Success</h3>
        <p>Sort Plus was successful because it functions the way I designed it to. Unfortunately, I don't find
          myself wanting to use it as much as I thought, but it may be due to a change in my listening habits.
        </p>
        <h3>What I Learned:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="bold">Minimum viable product (MVP): </span>Developing a minimum viable product 
            would have been helpful to test its usefulness before committing a lot of time into something
            I don't often use. Fortunately, the overall process helped me learn a lot.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js): </span>Prior to this project, I
            only had experience with React and some backend (server and database) experience with PHP and MySQL.
            I learned how to write the backend with Express, which connects to MongoDB with Mongoose.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">PWA (Progressive Web App): </span>I learned more about progressive web apps so
            that I could make Sort Plus work offline. They can be accessible across different platforms and can
            be made to work offline for users who don't always have access to the Internet.</li>
