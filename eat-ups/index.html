        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>In this game, the player is in control of the avatar and their goal is do as many chin-ups as they can so they can fulfill their New Yearâ€™s resolution of getting fitter. </p>

        <p>My contributions include the ideation and programming. I programmed the energy bar, user interface, game states, and all images except the food. I also made the HTML5 responsive so it could be played on any device.

        <h2>Challenge</h2>

        <p>A problem that I faced was with the programming of the animations. Eric and Peter had created a short animation of a chicken leg swinging for the background of the main menu, which only consisted of a few images. My initial implementation was placing one image element that periodically switched the source with JavaScript like I had done similarly for other games with animations. I experimented with a few solutions I found online to do this, but ended up with this stuttering animation.</p>

        <figure>
          <div class="figure-img side-by-side">
            <img src="../dist/images/eat-ups-animation-lag-cropped.gif" alt="Eat Ups gameplay with animation lag">
            <img src="../src/images/eat-ups-final-animation-cropped.gif" alt="Eat Ups gameplay with no animation lag">
          </div>
          <figcaption>Player performing as many chin-ups as possible before energy depletes</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>After working on other tasks for a bit, I revisited the problem and tried to improve it with other JavaScript solutions. Fortunately, I failed and I thought of using a GIF to show the animation instead. The animation consisted of only a few frames and the game was in HTML5, so a GIF seemed appropriate. The GIF was much more smoother and should display more consistently on multiple devices, than using JavaScript.</p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>In the end, Eat Ups was successful in that the game was complete enough for players to play through it repeatedly. I was able to learn more JavaScript too. To improve Eat Ups, I would want to make it look better on a desktop device, add a bit more complexity, and balance it. </p>
