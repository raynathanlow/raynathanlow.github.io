      <h1>PharmaQuest</h1>

      <p>PharmaQuest is a 2D single-player video game for the computer. It was created in a team of five to practice incorporating a narrative in a video game. My teammates were Katrina de Guzman, Eivan Nisperos, Joe Zhou, and Job Lee. This was done from
        February to March of 2017.
      </p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>PharmaQuest is played in an overhead perspective like in classic Pokemon games and it features a branching and foldback narrative. Branching means that the narrative will split into different branches where different events will occur, but sometimes
        they can return to the main branch, which is foldback. The narrative is of a near middle-aged man, named Werner, who recently became an intern at a pharmaceutical company. His love interest suddenly disappears and now he wants to get her back.
        He must sneak through the company building by finding and crafting to get his love interest back.</p>

      <h2>Contributions</h2>
      <p>I helped my teammates ideate the game’s concept and I developed some aspects of the game on Unity, using C#. More specifically, I developed the tutorial, the inventory system, and what happens when the player interact with all of the other game
        objects. </p>
    </section>

      <h2>Challenge</h2>

      <p>The main challenge I encountered was with the inventory system. Since we were doing a MacGyver style mechanic, which was essentially crafting, I had to implement an inventory system that could craft items.</p>

      <p>From the start, I was unsure of how to approach this inventory system. I came across two examples that seemed to do what I wanted for this system. I used one of the examples as the base and adapted some aspects of the other. For example, one of
        the examples includes a lot of attributes for each item like its power and durability. Since this game is linear and short, it was not necessary to include those attributes.</p>

      <p>As for the crafting system, it was fairly easy to program, but it got complicated when I was adding more quality of life features present in other game’s inventory systems.</p>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <section>
        <p>In the end, PharmaQuest was not fully complete. I did not manage my time to finish programming the third and last level that matched the design we had in mind. The first two levels were good enough though. Players could play through the game,
          the way we designed it, and progress to the next level. </p>

        <p>If I could do this again, I would start on my tasks earlier so that I could finish programming the levels and possibly refine it by adding more quality of life features or more items to find and craft.</p>

        <p>I learned how to use Unity and program in C# to produce a 2D game with a narrative. Even though the game was not fully complete, it was very satisfying to see people enjoy playing it. It has made me want to continue making games for myself and
          others to enjoy. </p>
