    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Ray. </p>
    <p>I'm currently Simon Fraser University studying in the <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/siat.html" target="_blank">School of Interactive Arts and Technology (SIAT)</a>. I’ve learned and practiced the iterative design process necessary to design user-friendly websites. This
      process involves a lot of research, prototyping, and testing which I'm grateful to have been exposed to since it can be used in designing other products.</p>
    <p>Video games, for example, also benefit from the iterative design process. More recently, I’ve been trying to create some games in my free time because I find it fulfilling to complete a game and see others enjoy playing it.</p>
    <p>Aside from trying to create games in my free time, I also like to play video games, watch TV, and listen to music. Since I’m mostly busy studying, I prefer playing games I can zone out in like Path of Exile or Diablo III. Similarly, I enjoy watching
      sitcoms as they don’t normally require a lot of thinking. Music-wise, I regularly listen to a lot of hip-hop, R&B, and pop.</p>
