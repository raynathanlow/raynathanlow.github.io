			<h2>Time Frame</h2>
			<p>March to April 2020</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Languages and Tools</h2>
			<p>Phaser, JavaScript, CSS</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Motivation</h2>
			<p>I wanted to experience what it is like to contribute to an open source project.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Contributions</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="bold">Suggested: </span>I suggested improvements to the resource bar design so that
					players know what actions they can take in various situations.
				</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Development: </span>I modified the style of the in-game statistics with CSS to
					improve visual consistency.
					I implemented the resource bar improvements with JavaScript and CSS based on the maintainer's
					design. A maintainer is someone who manages what work needs to be done and what code will be
					included in the official game. I also implemented visual feedback with JavaScript to show the result
					of an action before confirming the action.

			<h2>Challenge: Fix and Improve Resource Bar</h2>
			<p>Creatures consume resources to use their abilities. I fixed a JavaScript issue where a creature's
				resource bar sometimes renders past its bounds.</p>

			<h3>Resolved Issues and Suggested Improvements</h3>
			<p>I noticed an opportunity to improve the resource bar while I was fixing the issue. I suggested it to the
				maintainer who then redesigned the resource bar to communicate more information to the player.</p>

			<p>For example, a darker yellow indicates the resources an ability will consume while the lighter yellow
				indicates the resources that remain after an ability is used.</p>

			<figure> <img class="auto" src="../dist/images/ab-redesign-iteration-1.png"
					alt="Resource bar where top half is dark yellow and bottom half is yellow">
				<figcaption>Redesigned resource bar shows how much resources would be consumed and remain after casting
					an ability</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<h3>Modified Pre-existing Code to Implement Redesign</h3>
			<p>In my first attempt at implementing the redesign, I tried to change as little code as possible to avoid
				introducing more bugs, but the colours could not quite match the specifications.</p>
			<p>After gaining a better understanding of the code, I was eventually able to implement the redesign with
				the specified colours.</p>

			<figure> <img class="auto" src="../dist/images/ab-final.png" alt="One resource bar with top half is yellow and black stripe pattern while 
																				bottom half is yellow; Another resource bar with top half is black while 
																				bottom half is yellow and black stripe pattern">
				<figcaption>Final iteration of redesign that communicates more about resource usage</figcaption>

			<h2>Reflection</h2>
			<h3>Measuring Success</h3>
			<p>My contributions to Ancient Beast were successful since I was able to fix all the issues I started
				working on. I was even rewarded monetarily for my efforts.
			</p>

			<h3>What I Learned:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="bold">Write better code: </span>I learned how to write better code to meet the
					standards of the maintainer(s) before they merge it into the official game.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Work with pre-existing codebase: </span>I learned how to work with a large and
					pre-existing codebase, which differs from my previous projects that are smaller and written all on
					my own.</li>
				<li><span class="bold">Communication: </span>I also learned how to work and communicate with other
					programmers, which I did not have to do while working on my previous personal projects.</li>
			</ul>
