				<h2>Motivation</h2>
				<p>I wanted to gain experience contributing in an open source project, especially one that is relevant 
				to my interests.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Contributions</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="bold">Suggested: </span>I suggested improvements to the resource bar design so that 
						players better understand what actions they can take based on the available amount of resources.</li>
					<li><span class="bold">Development: </span>I modified the style of the in-game statistics with CSS 
						to improve visual consistency. I implemented the resource bar improvements with JavaScript and CSS 
						based on a maintainer's design. A maintainer is someone who manages what work needs to be done and 
						what code will be included to the official version of the game.</li>

				<h2>Challenge: Fix and Improve Resource Bar</h2>
				<p>Players of Ancient Beast materialise and control creatures by casting abilities to defeat the 
				opponent. I chose to resolve an issue where the resource bar sometimes renders past its bounds when 
				the player hovers over it.</p>

				<h3>Resolved Issues and Suggested Improvements</h3>
				<p>I was able to resolve the issue by modifying its JavaScript code, but I noticed an opportunity to
				improve it during testing. I noticed that when the player interacts with an ability, the 
				resource bar could show more information.</p>
				<p>Originally, when the player hovers over an ability that requires more resources than the creature 
				has, the resource bar changes colour and resizes to match the required amount of resources. It no 
				longer shows the current amount of resources the creature has.</p>

																	 alt="Resource bar with dark yellow fill and yellow outline">
					<figcaption>Resource bar's colour and size changes when hovering over an ability that requires more resources than the creature has</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>Fortunately, the maintainer I discussed with was able to redesign the resource bar that communicates 
				more information to the player.</p>
				<p>For example, a darker yellow indicates how much resources the ability would consume while yellow 
				indicates how much resources would remain after the ability has casted.</p>

																	 alt="Resource bar where top half is dark yellow and bottom half is yellow">
					<figcaption>Redesigned resource bar shows how much resources would be consumed and remain after casting an ability</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<h3>Modified Preexisting Code to Implement Redesign</h3>
				<p>My first attempt at implementing the redesign was not very successful because I tried to change 
				as little code as possible to avoid introducing more bugs. The redesign couldn't really be implemented 
				because of how the resource bar was initially coded though.</p>
				<p>After gaining a better understanding of the code, I was eventually able to implement the redesign.</p>

																				bottom half is yellow; Another resource bar with top half is black while

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<h3>Measuring Success</h3>
				<p>My contributions to Ancient Beast were successful since I was able to resolve the issues I chose to resolve.
				I was even rewarded monetarily for my efforts.
				</p>

				<h3>What I Learned:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="bold">Write better code: </span>I learned how to write better code because it will be 
						reviewed by the maintainer(s) before they merge it into the project.</li>
					<li><span class="bold">Work with preexisting codebase: </span>I learned how to work with preexisting codebase,
						which was different than working with my previous projects since I was usually a part of its creation. The 
						codebase was also larger than what I had worked with previously.</li>
					<li><span class="bold">Communication: </span>I also learned how to work and communicate with other programmers,
						which I didn't have to do while working on my previous two projects that I created on my own.</li>
