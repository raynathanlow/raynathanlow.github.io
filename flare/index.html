      <h1>Flare</h1>

      <p>Flare is an Android application that provides a quick way to request for help and prevent possible threats. It was created in a team of three to explore the capabilities of an Android device. My teammates were Eivan Nisperos and Stephen Lee. This
        was done from June to August of 2016.</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Flare features one main button that will run a set of functions once it is tapped. Before the functions are ran, there is a countdown period for the user to stop with a form of authentication, in case of an accidental tap. Some functions that could
        be ran include: automatically phoning a pre-set number, recording and uploading the current location, and turning on the flashlight. The main button can be switched to a different mode so it will only perform functions the user has chosen to run.
        In each of these modes, the user may set a different phone number to automatically phone.</p>

      <h2>Contributions</h2>
      <p>I primarily programmed the functionality and user interface. I used Android Studio where I programmed in Java for the functionality and XML for the user interface elements. Also, I helped ideate what the application should do and helped design its
        user experience.</p>

      <h2>Challenge</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>Pattern Lock Authentication</h3>
        <p>One of the major challenges I faced was with the implementation of the pattern lock authentication. There was no official method of programming a pattern lock in the Android Developers Guide, so I tried using a third-party library. I found a couple
          third-party libraries, but I felt I did not have enough time to figure out how to implement it.</p>

        <div>
          <div class="caption">

          <div class="caption">

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Consequently, we created our own form of authentication, which utilizes the Android Touch Framework. It was like a PIN, but it used four different colours instead of numbers. We thought that it would be simpler for the user to use it if they were
          incapacitated, but also that it was uncommon enough that the perpetrator may not be able to figure out how to stop the countdown in time before all the functions are invoked. I was able to program our new form of authentication by referring
          to examples from class.</p>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <section>
        <p>In the end, Flare was reasonably well done because it had the core functionality required to easily reach out for help when in an emergency. However, there were more functions that we wanted to implement, which could have been useful, but we could
          not figure out how to program it in time. For example, we wanted Flare to start recording audio and video so authorities could use it as evidence or a clue to find the victim. </p>

        <p>If I had a chance to do this again, I would try to find a way to make Flare accessible from other applications so that the user could request for help as soon as possible. The user could fail to tap the button in the seconds necessary to switch
          to the application itself.</p>

        <p>I learned how to develop an Android application that could be useful. In this case, for people who are caught in threatening situations. I also learned that Android has set some restrictions with runtime permissions so it prevents developers from
          violating the userâ€™s phone.</p>
