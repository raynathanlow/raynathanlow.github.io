            <h1>This Is America Tour</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Website redesign</p>

            <p>This is my redesign of Childish Gambino's This Is America Tour website where my goal was to make it more
                accessible and make the poster interactive.</p>

                        repository</a>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p><span class="bold">Time Frame</span></p>
            <p>September 28 - October 7, 2018</p>

            <p><span class="bold">Languages and Tools</span></p>
            <p>React, JavaScript, CSS, Photoshop</p>

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>I noticed that the poster depicting all the tour dates lacked the alt attribute which describes it for
                those
                who
                rely on screen readers. It wasn't particularly necessary because they could find the same information by
                visiting the link to Ticketmaster at the bottom of the page. However, I liked the typography used in the
                poster
                and wanted to make it more interactive by showing information when a user interacts with each date.</p>

            <div>
                <p>Screen readers tells those who are visually impaired, illiterate, or have a learning disability what
                    is
                    on
                    the screen through speech or braille.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Contributions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">Design: </span>I designed the user experience and interface with sketching and
                    Photoshop.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Development: </span>I wrote the user interface code with React, JavaScript, and
                    CSS.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Host: </span>I hosted this redesign on GitHub Pages.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Redesign Process</h2>
            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>To make the poster interactive, I decided that more information shows up when a fan clicks or taps each
                date. They wouldn't need to leave the site unless they wanted to buy tickets, which I provide a direct
                link to. Originally, fans can go to the Ticketmaster at the bottom of the page and then they find the
                show they want to go to. Some fans may see the city closest to them on the poster already, so my
                redesign gives them a quick way to buy those tickets.</p>

            </figure>

            <h3>Slice Shows with Photoshop</h3>
            <p>To make it simpler to implement, I designed the shows to be laid out in a grid. This required each show
                from the poster to be separated into multiple image files, which I did with Photoshop's slice tool.</p>

            <figure>
                <img class="this-is-america-tour-small " src="this-is-america-tour-slice.png" alt="Shows sliced with Photoshop">
                <figcaption>Shows sliced with Photoshop</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h3>Display Shows in Original Order</h3>
            <p>With the images ready, I was able to write the React code to display the shows in a grid. I planned to
                use the data from Ticketmaster to determine the order of the shows, but Childish Gambino suffered a leg
                injury midway through the tour. The remaining shows were rescheduled, but not in the same order. There
                was no updated poster at the time, so I chose to display the shows in the original order while
                indicating that they have been rescheduled. I was able to sort the data from Ticketmaster by the
                original order of shows by modifying JavaScript's sort function.</p>

            <h3>Make Site Accessible
            </h3>
            <p>After writing most of the React code, each show can be clicked or tapped on to reveal more information
                about the show, but it wasn't quite accessible yet. Some elements of the site can't be interacted with
                the keyboard by default, so I had to add the tabindex attribute to indicate that it is able to be
                interacted with the keyboard. I also added the alt and title attributes to images and interactable
                elements such as links. They provide screen readers with a description to read out since some links
                aren't easily understandable.</p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>My redesign of Childish Gambino's This Is America Tour website makes it more accessible and makes the
                poster
                interactive by enabling users to navigate with the keyboard and adding descriptions to images and
                interactable
                elements for screen readers. Clicking or tapping on the shows in the poster displays more information
                about
                it
                without having to go to Ticketmaster.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>

            <p>My redesign was somewhat successful because it is more accessible than the original website and the
                poster is
                interactive now, but it might have been unnecessary to do. Fans could directly visit Ticketmaster at the
                bottom
                of the original site to get tickets, which is accessible to those who rely on screen readers. However, I
                wanted
                to try something different and learn more about React and making websites accessible, which I
                accomplished.
            </p>

            <p>If I could redo this redesign, I would learn more about what can be done to make websites more accessible
                because I don't think I did enough.</p>

            <p>I learned more about:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">React: </span>I had no experience with React prior to this redesign, so I was
                    able to learn and practice
                    its
                    basics.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">HTTP requests: </span>My previous experience with HTTP requests were only with
                    PHP, which turns out to be
                    similar
                    in JavaScript, just written differently. HTTP requests are used to get data from other websites,
                    like
                    Ticketmaster.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Making sites more accessible: </span>I only knew about the alt attribute for
                    images and using semantic HTML
                    before
                    this project. Now, I know how to add descriptions to links and make certain elements able to be
                    navigated
                    with the keyboard.</li>
