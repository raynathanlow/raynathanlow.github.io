        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Housing 101 is a mock redesign of the Craigslist's housing section. It was created in a team of three to
          practice information architecture and develop a site that was responsive to any device.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Contributions</h2>
        <p>I helped ideate how the redesign should go about. I came up with wireframes and ideas of how some elements
          should be placed such as buttons and content. I developed certain pages of the website and helped around when
          needed. I adjusted the code
          to maintain consistency among the pages so that the website would appear cohesive and consistent.</p>

        <h2>Challenge</h2>

        <p>The challenges I encountered with this project occurred in both the information architecture and the
          development of the website.</p>
        <p>With the information architecture, there were times where we could not decide which design we should go
          with. It was easily resolved by testing each design and weighing the advantages and disadvantages to each
          that would better help the user find
          what they wanted, which was the overall goal. </p>
        <p>With the development of the website, sometimes we could not figure out what to write to achieve what we had
          in our wireframes. It was mostly with the CSS because we wanted to use Flexbox, a new method of creating
          layouts, that was especially useful
          for responsive sites. It took a lot of trial and error, and referring to online documentation until we
          finally reached the appearance of the wireframes.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>I thought that Housing 101 went very successfully. We were able to redesign the housing section so that it
          was not only easier to browse for housing, but also to post new postings. Along with the new information
          architecture, the site was made to
          be responsive to multiple screen sizes.</p>
        <p>If I were to do this differently, I would consider adding some animations to make it more visually
          appealing. I would also like to remake it with a server-side language such as PHP and a database, so users
          can actually search for specific posts
          and post new postings.</p>
        <p>I learned how to wireframe with different approaches so that navigation and reading of information on the
          site would be easy for users. I also learned how to write CSS so that the content would respond to different
          screen sizes.</p>
