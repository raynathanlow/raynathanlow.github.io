      <h1>Housing 101</h1>

      <p>Housing 101 is a mock redesign of the craigslist’ housing section. It was created in a team of three to practice information architecture and develop a site that was responsive to any device. My teammates were Zack Ng and Bassam Mirghani. This was
        done from June to August of 2015.</p>

      <h2>Contributions</h2>
      <p>I helped ideate how the redesign should go about. I came up with wireframes and ideas of how some elements should be placed such as buttons and content. I developed certain pages of the website and helped around when needed. I adjusted the code
        to maintain consistency among the pages so that the website would appear cohesive and consistent.</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>Homepage</h3>
        <p>For the homepage, we thought that it could be beneficial if we had two new sections to help the user find the housing that they wanted. These two new sections are: Recommended Posts and Top Posts.</p>

        <p>Recommended Posts are the posts that are most relevant to the user’s past searches that ideally can be recommended through an algorithm in the back-end, which was not part of the project’s scope.</p>

        <p>Top Posts are the posts that have been priced well regardless of the user’s past searches. Its goal is to provide the user with an idea of what housing is available and they may be inclined to buy something else outside of what they initially
          wanted. </p>

        <h3>Posting Process</h3>
        <p>For the posting process, our goal was to group together related information. This is because we found that the original posting process had separated related parts of the process into different pages, which seemed unnecessary. The first three
          pages consisted of radio buttons to choose the type of posting, category, and location, respectively. We combined those three pages into one page, so then users would only have to click “Continue” once instead of three times to get to the next
          part.</p>

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>The challenges I encountered with this project occurred in both the information architecture and the development of the website.</p>
      <p>With the information architecture, there were times where we could not decide which design we should go with. It was easily resolved by testing each design and weighing the advantages and disadvantages to each that would better help the user find
        what they wanted, which was the overall goal. </p>
      <p>With the development of the website, sometimes we could not figure out what to write to achieve what we had in our wireframes. It was mostly with the CSS because we wanted to use Flexbox, a new method of creating layouts, that was especially useful
        for responsive sites. It took a lot of trial and error, and referring to online documentation until we finally reached the appearance of the wireframes.</p>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>I thought that Housing 101 went very successfully. We were able to redesign the housing section so that it was not only easier to browse for housing, but also to post new postings. Along with the new information architecture, the site was made to
        be responsive to multiple screen sizes.</p>
      <p>If I were to do this differently, I would consider adding some animations to make it more visually appealing. I would also like to remake it with a server-side language such as PHP and a database, so users can actually search for specific posts
        and post new postings.</p>
      <p>I learned how to wireframe with different approaches so that navigation and reading of information on the site would be easy for users. I also learned how to write CSS so that the content would respond to different screen sizes.</p>
